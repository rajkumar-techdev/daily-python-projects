# 🐍 Daily Python Projects by Rajkumar

Hi! I'm Rajkumar 👨‍💻

This repository is my personal challenge to build **one Python mini project every day**. The goal is to stay consistent, learn by doing, and become strong in Python fundamentals — moving from **basic**, to **intermediate**, and eventually **advanced** projects.
